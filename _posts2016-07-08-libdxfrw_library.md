#libdxfrw library:- c++ library (read/write dxf files)

**It is used to make :-**
line
point
text


**library structure:-**
	1. entitywriter.cpp (function define)
	2. entitywriter.h (functions declaring)
	3. main.cpp (execute input.cpp file of user)
	4. input.cpp (user end file)	


**entitywriter.h:-**
	there are all the functions inside it
	like function of line,circle.
	declaring variable in input.cpp files

using loops in input.cpp files (everything in c++).
parameteric input by variables declaring above.

**entities:-**

	point 
	text
	arc
	trace
	dimensions - not working at present
	wall
	

**Discussion of layer function:-**

	Create layers above before drawing a entites. And if the user want to use a specfic layer for multiple different entities then he/she can 		
	use as 
		set <layer_name>{ 
			entities;
		}	

**To do:-**

	run program through cgi. User can give the input in the form as webpage by CGI.


**Question asked by saini:**

	sir reply: arc everytimes is circular but not parabolic. (i.e. spline)

Sir suggested use this library unstead Autocad (to civil student): because it take time to start.

**Asked question by Monisha :**

What would be the arguments of the dimension :

	Sir replied, first give dimension on graph paper manually.
Or
Dimensioning:

	two point pass in dimensions: (starting point, ending point)
